**About commit message**

It is desirable to write a commit message like this:

```
Type: Title

Body (Optional)

Footer (Optional)
```

The type labels are:

- Feat: when new features are added
- Fix: when bugs or issues are fixed
- Docs: when documents are updated
- Style: when code formats are changed (no significant code modification)

The beginning of the title starts with the base form of verb and the first letter should be capitalized

The total number of characters in title is less than 50 characters, and a period (.) is not added at the end
